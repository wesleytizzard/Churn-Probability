# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. It demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and interpretation of results.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing (1. Preprocessing.ipynb)
- Loaded and cleaned a dataset of 90,000 customer records with 100 features
- Handled missing values, outliers, and encoded categorical variables
- Performed feature engineering, including creating aggregate features

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed target variable distribution and relationships with features
- Visualized key insights using matplotlib and seaborn

### 3. Model Development (2. Model.ipynb)
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Implemented and compared multiple models:
  - CatBoost Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
- Performed cross-validation to assess model performance
- Selected final model based on AUC scores

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated model on test set using various metrics:
  - ROC AUC Score
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Visualized results with ROC curve and confusion matrix

### 5. Model Interpretation
- Used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret feature importance and impact on predictions

### 6. Prediction Pipeline (3. Predict.ipynb)
- Developed a prediction pipeline to process new data and generate churn predictions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- CatBoost, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SHAP

## Key Achievements
- Developed a model with AUC score of 0.6865 on test data
- Identified key factors influencing customer churn
- Created a reusable pipeline for making predictions on new data

This project demonstrates proficiency in end-to-end machine learning project development, from data preprocessing to model deployment, with a focus on solving real-world business problems in the telecommunications industry.
